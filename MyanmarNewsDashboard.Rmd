About
=========================================================================
**Background**  
Coup d'Ã©tat staged by the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Military) back in February has jeopardized the young democracy the country was enjoying, and undermined its development as well as the livelihood of its people.

**Approach**  
In this project, ~32000 news articles from various news sources were scrapped from the internet and news titles were analyzed.  The project consists of 3 stages-   
1. Web-scrapping the news  
2. Cleaning and processing data  
3. Visualizing the data in a Dashboard  
  
Some of the packages used in each stage are  
1. rvest, dplyr  
2. readr, dplyr, tidyr, tidytext, xts  
3. ggplot2, plotly, wordcloud2, DT, dygraphs, viridis  

Dashboard was built as Shiny Interactive Dashboard using Flexdashboard package. tidytext package was used instead of other popular textmining packages such as tm since the analysis is only performed on news title and no ML model will be used as well as easier work required to create beautiful visualizations. 

The project is constrained in that only titles of news were analyzed and not the actual news body. This is because it is quite difficult (for me at least) to web-scrap news body from hundreds of news sources, each with their own web layout.

**Qualitative Summary of Analysis**  
Unsurprisingly, some of the most commonly used words in news title were "coup", "military", "protest", etc. reflecting the political turmoil of the country. In addition, the average sentiment of all articles by each news source for the duration of time data were collected were overwhelmingly negative. In fact, the sentiments of news article titles significantly dropped after Feb 1st - the day the coup was staged.
